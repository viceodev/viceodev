## About Me
Hi! I'm Victor Okonkwo, a recent graduate of Mechatronics Engineering from a technical university in Nigeria ( Federal University of Technology Owerri - FUTO ). Creating value and solving a "need" is the essence of every working system / research project. As a backend developer, I understand this and strive to give my best to any project I am a part of while complimenting this effort with fresh ideas that makes any team I am part of more effective.

I am open to `Backend Developer` openings. Let's connect!

#### Here is my [portfolio](https://github.com/viceodev/viceodev/blob/a050c3616272b27b64c9ee9241515cdc9f12cfe5/Ebube%20Okonkwo%20CV.pdf)

## My Interests

- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Scientific Research
- Backend Software Engineering (BE)
- Open Source
