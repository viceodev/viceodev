## About Me
Hi! I'm Ebube Okonkwo, a passionate researcher with a Mechatronics Engineering background currently growing as a Full-stack engineer. 

I had a dream or rather **a lot** of dreams‚ò∫ growing up as a young teenager. I envisioned myself building great systems in the future and being one of the great men who positively changed the world. This motivated me as a young high school student to learn about technology. 

The career that started as a move towards a dream has evolved to be a personal mission to join forces with great institutions to bring life changing solutions to the world. In recent times, my personal slogan has been **life does not have to be hard** and really it does not. I believe second to moral excellence, technology can and has paved the way towards a better and easier future. A future where dreams and visions easily come to life; and flourish.

I am currently open to working with `vision-driven` clients to bring their ideas to life. Got an idea? Let's connect!
