# About Me
Hi! I'm Victor Okonkwo, a recent graduate of Mechatronics Engineering from a technical university in Nigeria ( Federal University of Technology Owerri - FUTO ). Creating value and solving a "need" is the essence of every working system / research project. As a backend developer, I understand this and strive to give my best to any project I am a part of while complimenting this effort with fresh ideas that makes any team I am part of more effective.

I am open to Backend Developer opportunities in Europe, particularly in IoT or AI. Let's connect!

# My Interests
I am very much interested in a number of things both as a hobby and as a long term committment. The following list shows the most important to me;

- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Scientific Research
- Backend Software Engineering (BE)
- Open Source

# Top Technologies I Use
At my current level, I have played around with a number of technologies but here are my top tools which i am very comfortable using.
